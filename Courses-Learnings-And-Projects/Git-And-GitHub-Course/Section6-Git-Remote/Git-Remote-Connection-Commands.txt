3. git remote -v (it will show the GitHub repository fetch and push)

4. git pull origin master / git pull - to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content (from remote to local)

5. git push -u origin master - to push the commits from local repository to the remote repository present in the GitHub. (from local to remote)

6. git push origin newbranch - it will make a new branch and commit the changes in it on the remote repository
