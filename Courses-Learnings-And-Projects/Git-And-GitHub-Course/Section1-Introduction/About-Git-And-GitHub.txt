WHAT IS GIT?

> Git is based on the large number of software known as Source Control or Version Control.
> Source control, or version control, is a way of tracking your files progress over time.
> It is usually saved in a series of snapshots and branches, which you can move back and forth between.

Source control allows you to:
> Distribute your file changes over time
> Prevent against data loss/damage by creating backup snapshots
> Manage complex project structures

Git: is a source control software, it follows all the same rules and concepts that any source control follows.

Git is most popular source control software in the world.
Lots of documentation and support.
Lots of integration with other applications (SourceTree, Heroku, GitHub)
