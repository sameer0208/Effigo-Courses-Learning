Docker
What is Docker?
Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. A developer defines all the applications and it's dependencies in a Dockerfile which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker container. Doing this ensures that your application will run in any environment.

In short - a platform for building, running and shipping applications

CONTAINER						VIRTUAL MACHINE
1. An isolated environment for 			An abstraction of a machine (physical
running an application				hardware)

Kernel - manages applications and hardware resources

Docker image consists of:
> A cut-down OS
> A runtime environment 
> Application files
> Third-party libraries
> Environment variables

Dockers are PORTABLE and LIGHT WEIGHT

Docker Image - is an executable file (having instruction in what way our container should be made)
User one Image we can make multiple containers.
Docker is basically like a static snapshot, what the code and the dependencies or what the local development environment is going to look like.

We can relate Docker Image as class and Containers as its objects
So container is basically like an instance of Docker Image.

Commands:
> docker pull <image> (e.g.<image> = hello-world) --> Download a docker image from Docker Hub.
> docker run <image> --> Run a container from an image (creates and starts the container).
> docker build -t springbootjarname . (to make docker image of a project)
> docker image ls {it will show what docker image has)
> docker run -p 9090:8080 springbootjarname (9090 is a docker port, and 8080 is a local port)
> docker image ls / docker images(it will show whatever docker image we have)
> docker logs containerId
> docker ps (it shows the running container)
> docker ps -a (it shows all the containers running or not running)
> 
For Spring boot project:
> Create Dockerfile

> FROM openjdk:17
EXPOSE 8080
ADD target/spring-boot-learning-portal-docker.jar spring-boot-learning-portal-docker.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/spring-boot-learning-portal-docker.jar"]

> To create jar file go to pom.xml and in that in the build tag add the line
<finalName>spring-boot-learning-portal-docker</finalName>

> then open cmd and give command to create a docker image:  docker build -t spring-boot-learning-portal-docker.jar .

> To run the docker image run the command:
 docker run -p 9090:8080 spring-boot-learning-portal-docker.jar (docker image name)
